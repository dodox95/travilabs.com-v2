Imagine the world without any need to trust second side. You won't have to trust
anybody - the trust problem is not the problem of us - great, don't it?

By default the trust problem disappear, so we can make a deal with anyone! even with a person we do not trust.
I don't want to say that people are trustless, that we shouldn't trust anyone but it's not the point but the reality often pops up the human nature when the money are on the table and we need to divide it.

### Smart Contracts - 1994 by Nick Szabo ->

Read the entire article of `Nick Szabo` [smart.contracts.html](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html)

> A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitration and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs

Nick Szabo in 1994 did write about Smart Contracts. He knows very well what potential Smart Contracts have. We have to understand that many of people before Nick Szabo mind about resolutions similar to Smart Contract - cuz the problem of the trust is knowing from the early past of the human history.

Imagine situation where one country don't trust second but they want to make a deal. The first country offers to make a deal by using smart contracts and the second side agrees. If the conditions will spend the smart contract does the transaction between two sides, and the both sides can't scam each other cuz the money are on the smart contract account.

```html
Jimmy: ok! but okey! but you're coloring a bit! don't you think the smart
contract can be hacked by any of the parties? or just be cheated in some way?
```

That's good question. As long as I live on this planet and I use internet I saw many, many kind of scams. We often say that the world economy runs from crisis to crisis - isn't this also the case with technology and everything around us? Of course we will see the problems with smart contracts but any new problem will likely be fixed as soon as possible.Once companies responsible for creating smart contracts for large contractors even such as various countries enter the market, it will be in the interest of these companies to secure smart contracts to the maximum extent possible.

Of course, there will also be organizations trying like lawyers to circumvent certain smart contract frameworks to the benefit of one party and to the detriment of the other, but isn't it precisely such situations that will make the legal structures and guidelines and the technology itself develop, creating smart contracts even tighter?

## What to expect from here on out

People can say that speculate about the future is pointless - and I think in the half the right - so let's speculate about nowadays.

The reasons that make Ethereum great

### 1. Smart Contracts.

Smart Contracts of course gives us big opportunites to make rules into our deal. For example I can say you I will give you 0.1ETH per every month for 1year so on the smart contract will be send 1.2 ETH and will be distributed for every month 0.1ETH to the user.

### 2. DAO.

The democracy is the system that people hate and love but so far no one has come up with anything better. DAO is the part of the democracy on the blockchain! A vote in which some group of people will participate, such as those who have NFT data and can vote for something. So if you have tokens or any NFT you will be able to vote in a given group for some decision. DAO supports democracy, but you also have to be careful because one person can be behind a bunch of wallets - this is also a big problem for DAO.

### 3. Tokens.

The great opportunites that Ethereum let us is to create own token. Of course today it's not the quantum physics and many blockchains like The Open Network or Solana let it but still it's important if we want to talk about Ethereum blockchain.

### 4. Layers 2

Yes, transactions on Ethereum are so expensive and there's no doubt but here the layers 2 are the hole path for that. The problem with expensive transactions are known from years but there's no easy way out to fix this problem only by fix on Ethereum blockchain side. As the same problem as Bitcoin has and resolves by using Lighting Network, Ethereum wants to do the same by using Layers 2 like Arbitrum, ZkSync, Base, Optimism and so on.

Why I treat Layers 2 as a big positive case in Ethereum? It is known that I would prefer that the problem of expensive transactions be fixed already on layer1 of Ethereum itself, but layer2 give incredible speculative value, and also the capital flows from L2 to L2 - which can be seen when some other L2 comes out then suddenly from another L2 flows to this new one - one can speculate.

### 5. Solidity

Ohh yes! I can talk about Solidity in hours this great language to creating smart contracts are awesome. I can compare Solidity to FunC or ChiaLisp and the results are easy: Solidity won always in all cases. It's important to know that Solidity we use in all blockchains that use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum (all L2), Cronos and so on.

### Ethereum vs Bitcoin - which one to choose?

<Image src="/bitcoin-vs.-ethereum.webp" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />

The old cryptocurrency question is which one is better? Bitcoin or Ethereum? but... this question is pointless.

there's no point to ask people about what do you prefer to buy? a bicyle or maybe a car? is this question pointless - YES!
We need the both cuz it depends what we need in the different situations - the same case is with Bitcoin vs Ethereum - I choose both.

People when I ask about Ethereum vs Bitcoin their choice is different but the point is always the same - speculation of the price. If we for a while forget about the assets price and we foucs on the technology the image before us becomes clearer. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency ever so it's the first the blockchain technology representant and its technology is just old. Ethereum is from 2015 and now we got newest technologies but comparing Ethereum to Bitcoin technology gives simple results. If we talking about the transfers the fast and the how many per a block is able Ethereum wins but layers2 fix the problem in both of them.

Bitcoin is great for the Bitcoin transfer and that's okay and that's enough but Ethereum also can transfer assets but we also can do smart contracts, mint NFTs, DAOs and so on.

I think many Bitcoin dev club fans could say that on Bitcoin we also can create smart contracts but... I don't think so it's a better idea than on Ethereum - trust me. So from the technology side Ethereum of course let us on more than only transfer Ethereum from wallet to another wallet.

### So.. my choice is both!

Bitcoin today is like a digital gold and many Bitcoin killers have better technology but who cares? It doesn't matter what Bitcoin has not what its killer does. Like Carl Menger said: "People make assets the value", and the same case with Bitcoin - no matter how many Bitcoin's killers will come.

Diversification doesn't have to be just for various other assets, for crypto it's also something normal. Many people trade between Bitcoin and Ethereum exclusively. When ETH falls to BTC they buy ETH, and the other way around. You have to consider the fact that you can buy BTC and buy ETH, and you don't have to focus on the answer to the question of whether ETH or BTC - what a silly way of thinking.

Stop thinking too long about all this and just treat ETH and BTC the same way love them both.

## A vision of the business world using Ethereum.

### Ethereum will change the world of the bussines.

I like the vision of the busines when people focus only on their skills and make services with no thinking about the trustless people. The vision of the countries that make deals between them each other by using blockchain technology to make it all clear to people and to be fair in the democracy system at all.

Of course the vision when one country deals with second only on blockchain is funny but who knows? I guess the new economy is an utopia cuz Bitcoin or Ethereum will not become the same as Dollar is but they will be great assets, but by using blockchain, smart contracts and so on we could see the current economy using the blockchain technology.

For example dollars issued on the blockchain (CBDC) is interesting technology but of course controversial. And the deals on the blockchain by using CBDC could be done by using smart contracts between two sides - a seller and a buyer.

### Don't be affraid of the future

People when think about the future they see the black scenario of the cataclysm. AI? = People will lost, Internet? = stupid kids and so on and so on that's funny. The same thing will be with Ethereum and the entire blockchain technology. Don't be affraid of the future because what is supposed to happen will happen anyway. And people are not as important as they think they are.
